This is essentially the contents of the SQL Syntax slides from lecture:

SELECT <columns>
  Which columns to return, or * for all

FROM <table>
  Which table to use

WHERE <row predicate>
  What rows to match

GROUP BY <columns>
  Combine rows with common values in some columns

HAVING <group predicate>
  Like WHERE, but for rows that have been grouped

ORDER BY <columns>
  What columns to use when sorting results

=, <>, <, >, >=, <=
  Standard binary comparators

AND, OR
  Logical operators

<expr> BETWEEN <min> AND <max>
  Range selection

<expr> LIKE <pattern>
  Match a pattern, with % as glob

<expr> IN (<val1>, <val2>, ...)
  Match one of a set of values

<expr> IS [NOT] NULL|TRUE|FALSE
  Null or truth testing

SELECT <expr> AS <newcol>
  Rename a column/expression in the output

;
  Statement terminator

-- <comment>
  Comments

AVG(<expr>), COUNT(<expr>)
  Basic statistics

INSERT INTO <table> [(<col>, ...)] VALUES (<expr>, ...)
  Add rows to a table (instead of SELECT)

UPDATE <table> SET <col> = <expr> WHERE <pred>
  Modify exsiting rows (instead of SELECT)

DELETE
  Remove rows (instead of SELECT)

CASE WHEN <pred1> THEN <expr1> WHEN <pred2> THEN <expr2> ELSE <expr3> END
  Cascading-if


Examples:

  SELECT Email FROM Users WHERE Name="Joel Robinson";

  UPDATE Users SET Email="golden@gizmonic" WHERE DOB="4/1/1988"; -- this is a comment

  INSERT INTO Users Values('Mike Nelson', '10/11/1964', 'mike@gizmonic', ...);

  DROP TABLE Users;
