Task 1: Fast-Flux DNS

  Here are some domain names culled from spam I've received:

     1l60s0m1jm1par.w1.knynjh.ml
     k361lijbn104r0.w0.bgpeyq.cf
     dz61vc0f1120at.w1.aumhze.ga

  Use the "dig" program to retrieve their DNS records. The most
  relevant pieces of the output for our purposes will be the QUESTION
  and ANSWER sections. The ANSWER section will look something like

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    <host name> <TTL> IN <record type> <value>

  A record of type "A" gives an address binding, so <value> will
  be an IP address.  The TTL is the number of seconds until this
  record is no longer valid, and a fresh request will need to be
  made.  The AUTHORITY and ADDITIONAL sections have nameserver
  information, also with TTLs. Some of these will be additional A
  records, but many (especially in AUTHORITY) will be NS records,
  which provide hostnames that provide authoritative records for
  <host name>.

  Compare these to responses for

     www.google.com
     gizmonic.cs.umd.edu

  There's another utility, called "whois", that retrieves domain
  name registration information. Try running whois on some of the
  domains, like "knynjh.ml", "bgpeyq.cf", and "google.com". How
  do these differ? Where are these domains registered? What can you
  figure out about the geographical distribution of the services
  being used?

  DO NOT VISIT ANY OF THESE SITES! There may or may not be malware,
  but they *are* shady, and do not deserve any network traffic that
  appears to boost their profile or credibility.

Task 2: Reverse lookups
    
  Both dig (with the "-x" flag) and whois take IP addresses, as
  well.  These are reverse lookups, and you might expect that if

     dig <hostname>

  return <addr>, that

     dig -x <addr>

  would return <hostname>. Is that what happens for these addresses?
  If not, why might that be the case?

  For whois, the reverse lookup tells you

   a) What subnet it's a member of, and
   b) Who owns that subnet

  Compare "whois <domain>" and "whois <addr>".  What does this tell
  you?
